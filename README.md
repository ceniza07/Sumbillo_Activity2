# Sumbillo_Activity2

### Activities:
1. Write a complete C program that takes in double values for x and y, and then compute and display their absolute difference (|x-y|).

2. Write a complete C program that prompts the user for the Cartesian coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and display the distance between them computed using the following formula: distance = (𝑥22+𝑥12) + (𝑦22 + 𝑦12)---------------------------- ( x2,Power2 + x1power2)

3 Write a complete C program that prompts the user to enter the positive integer values for x and y, compute x, y and display the result.
